        <h1>Machine Directory</h1>
        <p>The Machine Directory contains a catalogue of some of the most influential pinball machines released throughout the years and a brief history of Pinball as a whole. The machines shown are ones we suggest and favoritize.</p>

        <h3>Origins During the Great Depression</h3>
        <p>Pinball, as we know it today, originated during the Great Depression, a time when affordable amusement was in high demand among Americans. It evolved from the French game bagatelle, where players guided balls past pins to score points by landing them in different holes on the playfield.</p>

        <h3>Early Development and Legal Challenges</h3>
        <p>The initial versions of pinball machines lacked flippers, making the game more about chance than skill as players manipulated the playfield to direct balls into scoring holes. Due to its luck-based gameplay, pinball was classified as gambling and was banned in the 1940s, despite the introduction of game-changing flippers in 1947.</p>

        <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, pinball machines continued to evolve technologically but remained fundamentally electromechanical.

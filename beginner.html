        <h2>Beginner's Guide to Pinball </h2>
        <p>The Beginner's Guide gives newcomers the foundational knowledge needed to start their pinball journey. This page ensures that individuals of all backgrounds can begin to enjoy pinball. It will cover the basics of gameplay, understanding the pinball machine layout, scoring, and tips for getting started. Thank you to Home Leisure Direct for providing the tutorial videos!</p>

        <h3>Basics</h3>
        <p>Each pinball game typically consists of three balls, essentially making up your three turns. Players use the buttons on each side of the machine to control the flippers to direct the ball through the various parts of the machine. To play, insert coins (usually 50 cents or $1 per game) and press the Start button on the front left of the machine. Sometimes, games will give a free game if you spend a certain amount at once (ex. $2 = 3 credits). You launch the ball using either pulling and releasing the plunger or pushing the Launch button on the front right of the machine.</p>

        <h3>Multi-Player</h3>
        <p>Every credit allows one game. However, if you insert multiple credits into one machine, then push the Start button 2, 3, or 4 times, 2-4 people can play at once. Each player plays one ball, then lets the next player play their ball until all players have played all three balls. The player with the highest score wins. Remember to bring friends!</p>

        <h3>Match</h3>
        <p>Match is the term used for a free game after playing. If the last two digits of your score matches the two digits on the dmd screen, then the machine will pop loudly, called the kicker, and you will be rewarded with a free credit.</p>
        <p>Tip: If you see a far off machine with the start button flashing, that means there's a free game! Rush over and play! This usually happens because people walk away before matching for a free game at the end</p>

        <h3>Draining</h3>
        <p>Draining is the term used whenever you lose one of your balls. Either straight down the middle between the flippers or in one of the out lanes to the left and right of the flippers. Most machines have only two outlanes, but some will have even more!</p>
        <p>Tip: You will lose your balls! It's inevitable! So, do not worry about it and just focus on scoring and shooting. Every game comes to an end, for every person.</p>
        <p>Additionally, inside every machine there is something called a "tilt bob". If you shake or nudge a machien too much, you will have up to two TILT warnings until the machine turns off your flippers and drains your ball. Let that be a lesson to ya!</p>

        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <p>Use your flippers to guide and shoot the ball into a specific place. Most of the time, shoot for the blinking or lit lights, the machine is essentially telling you what to shoot for.</p>
        <p>Tip: The longer you keep your ball alive and the more shots you make the higher your score will be.</p>
        <p>Modern machines have multiple modes/missions coded into them for the player to progress through. These will reward many points and will light up a signal on the playfield indicating their respective completion if finished</p>
        <p>Additionally, if all modes are completed on a machine, usually a final mode, termed the "Wizard Mode" will become available and usually signifies a player beating a game if completed</p>
        <br> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LyXNmefmXdk?si=zWG-FGDbC0sTplyx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br>
        <p>Additionally, each machine is set with a certain score, that if surpassed, will lead to a free game which is signified with the knocker going off. This will also be achieved if the player surpasses the high score. Double up!</p>
        <p>Also, multiballs are a big part of scoring high. These can be started by hitting certain shots a certain amount of times!</p>
        <p>Skill Shots: These are awards a player can go for before at the start of a game. Usually determine by the strength of the plunge or shooting a specific shot with the flippers immediately after launch</p>

        <h3>Targets</h3>
        <p>There are multiple things on a machine that you will encounter and want to shoot for. We will discuss them below: </p>
        <p>Target Arrows: One of the most basic targets. Will usually light up or blink on the playfield telling you to shoot there.</p>
        <p>Drop Targets: Are targets that when hit, will drop into the playfield, clearing your path for the next shot.</p>
        <p>Ramps: Are essentially loops or roller-coaster like pathways. They are essential for progressing through machines' code</p>
        <p>Scoops: Are indentations/ball captures in the playfield. They are essential to progressing through machines' code</p>
        <p>Spinners: Just like their name, they spin! When a ball passes through them, for each time they spin, they give a small number of points</p>
        <p>Bumpers: These are most commonly found in the back of the playfield and right above the flippers. When hit, the ball will shoot off them with great force and reward a small number of points!</p>
        <p>Toys: Almost every machine will have their own "toys". Usually molded plastic or a gimick to make the game unique to their respective theme/design. These are too broad to accurately define, but you will know em when you see em!</p>

        <h3>Flippers</h3>
        <p>This wouldn't be a starting guide if we don't mention the flippers! In most basic terms, you will hold, catch, aim, and shoot the ball using the flippers. However, we will discuss this on the Advanced Strategies and Techniques page</p>

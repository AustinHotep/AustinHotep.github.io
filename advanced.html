        <h2>Advanced Strategies and Techniques </h2>
        <p>The Advanced Guide gives veterans the expanded knowledge needed to continue their pinball journey. However, this page still ensures that individuals of all backgrounds can keep enjoying pinball. It will cover the intracacies of gameplay, teaching the necessary flipper skills, etc. needed to keep your ball from draining. Thank you to Abe Flips for providing the tutorial videos!</p>
        <p>Tip: ALL of the techniques mentioned below can be combined or set up with eachother; doing so will set an evolving player up for the skilled handling/cradling of a ball.</p>

        <h3>Shielding</h3>
        <p>Shielding is the use of your flippers to reduce the center gap in between a game's flippers.</p>
        <p>Whenever the ball is coming back at an angle, it is good practice to train oneself to shield the center outlane!</p>

        <h3>Micro Flips</h3>
        <p>A micro flip is the technique of slightly and quickly tapping the flipper button with as the ball as it is being cradled or rolling on a flipper.</p>
        <p>This can be used for transferring the ball to the other flipper, back to the same flipper, or to flipper return lanes!</p>

        <h3>Post Pass</h3>
        <p>Post passing is used to transfer a cradled ball to another flipper by quickly letting go and rehitting the flipper button as a ball is being cradled.</p>
        <p>Make sure to keep the dominant flipper up or you will drain!</p>
        <p>If done correctly, the ball will bounce off the bumper, rehitting the dominant flipper, and bouncing over to the second flipper.</p>

        <h3>Dead Bounce</h3>
        <p>Dead bouncing is leaving the flippers stationary when a ball is coming down towards them. Leave your flippers alone and the ball will bounce off and onto the opposite flipper!</p>
        <p>Doing this also reduces a balls momentum and leaves less room for error when trying to gainc control.</p>
        <p>Tip: Make sure the machine's flippers are not loose or worn when playing! If so, the flipper may absorb the ball's energy when hit and the ball will roll straight down the middle.</p>

        <h3>Ski Pass</h3>
        <p>A ski pass is done when holding the flipper up as the ball rolls down the flipper return lane. The idea is the ball will have enough momentum to roll to the opposite flipper.</p>
        <p>Tip: An upward nudge may be used to ensure this technique. ALthough, make sure not to nudge to much and hit a bumper!</p>

        <h3>Drop Catch</h3>
        <p>Drop catching is done when holding the flipper up as the ball comes down, with correct timing, letting go of the flipper at the precise moment when the ball hits it. </p>
        <p>If done correctly, the ball will stop dead for a moment before rolling back down the flipper. This is done so the player can gain ball control and set up a safe shot.</p>
        <p>Tip: This is easier than live catching.</p>

        <h3>Live Catch</h3>
        <p>Live catching is done when the ball comes down, with correct timing, hitting the flipper button at the precise moment the ball would make contact with a stationary flipper that's up.</p>
        <p>If done correctly, the moving flipper will absorb the ball's momentum and stop dead on the flipper. This is done so the player can gain ball control and plan their next move.</p>
        <p>Tip: This is harder than drop catching.</p>
        <br> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjALq96jpJQ?si=VULhhQanClu9Ndtn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br>

        <h3>Slap Save</h3>
        <p>Slap saving is done when a ball is rolling down the middle. Slapping one side of the cabinet's flipper button that's closest to the ball, followed up with a second slap of the opposite side's flipper button.</p>
        <p>This will save many balls but will not always work as different game's have different flipper gaps.</p>
        <p>A single slap slave is possibe too, but requires a harder slap with more momentum. We suggest your dominant hand for this!</p>

        <h3>Nudging</h3>
        <p>Maybe the most important skill of pinball, but also the hardest, nudging is essential to the art of pinball.</p>
        <p>For starters, nudging is used to alter the ball's speed and direction by slightly moving the machine up, left, right, and down.</p>
        <p>Doing this will effect the ball's rebound on multiple obstacles, as you are moving the machine underneath the ball.</p>
        <p>Usually, nudging is done to keep the ball out of the "danger zone," which is the area around the top of the outlanes. A player can nudge the ball to bounce away from the outlanes with correct timing and force.</p>
